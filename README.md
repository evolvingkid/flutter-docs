### Dart

dart can be compiled to JavaScript so that it can be run on any modern browser. The dart SDK have a dart to JS compiler called dart2js. Which takes dart code and compile to Vanilla JS.

Dart VM also allows us to run dart to run as a standalone CLI script like any other programming language.
